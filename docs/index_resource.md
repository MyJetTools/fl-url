# FLUrl

A fluent, async HTTP client library for Rust, inspired by the .NET Flurl library (https://flurl.dev/).

FLUrl is a Hyper-based HTTP client that provides a fluent API for building and executing HTTP requests with connection pooling, retry logic, and comprehensive body type support.

This page is everything an ordinary request needs: installation, building and sending requests, bodies, responses and errors. The rest — WASM, streamed bodies, request models, connections, TLS, SSH, unix sockets, retries, timeouts and limits, compression, debugging — are topics, listed at the end. Read a topic: `resource://flurl-usage-guide/{topic}`, or `get_flurl_usage_guide` with `topic`.

## Features

- **Fluent API**: Chain methods to build requests naturally
- **Connection Reuse**: Automatic connection pooling and reuse for HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2
- **Multiple HTTP Modes**: Support for HTTP/2, HTTP/1.1 with Hyper, and HTTP/1.1 without Hyper
- **Body Types**: JSON, URL-encoded, multipart/form-data, and raw data
- **SSL/TLS**: Opt-in via one of two provider features — `with-ring-tls` (ring) or `with-rust-tls` (pure Rust, no C toolchain). Client certificate support and invalid certificate acceptance. With neither, the crate never links rustls and an `https://` request fails with `FlUrlError::UnsupportedScheme`
- **SSH Tunneling**: Optional SSH tunnel support via `with-ssh` feature
- **Unix Socket Support**: Native Unix socket support (Unix systems only)
- **Known IP, no DNS**: `https://domain.com@15.0.0.5/path` connects to the ip while the Host header and TLS SNI stay `domain.com` (native only) — see [Connecting to a Known IP](known-ip.md)
- **Retry Logic**: `with_retries(n)` replays a request that got no response; `with_retry(delay, n)` also replays a 5xx, `delay` apart, to ride out a restart of the service — see [Retry Logic](retries.md)
- **Request Compression**: `compress()` gzips a request body of 64 bytes and up
- **Streaming Responses**: Support for streaming response bodies (native only)
- **Streaming Request Bodies**: Send a body of any size at constant memory, framed with `Content-Length` or chunked (native only) — see [Streamed Body](streamed-body.md)
- **Debug Support**: Built-in request debugging capabilities
- **WASM Support**: The same API compiles to `wasm32-unknown-unknown` (browser / web-worker) on top of the `fetch` API — see [WebAssembly (WASM) Support](wasm.md)

## Installation

`flurl` is not published on crates.io — it is pulled from git, pinned to a release
tag. Add to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
flurl = { tag = "0.7.0", git = "https://github.com/MyJetTools/fl-url.git" }
```

**`https://` needs a TLS provider feature.** Both are off by default, so a
project doing plain HTTP (or unix sockets, or SSH tunnels) does not pay for the
rustls stack — `my-tls`, `rustls`, `tokio-rustls` and the provider itself all
leave the dependency tree. In a build with neither, a request to an `https://` url
returns `FlUrlError::UnsupportedScheme` — `FlUrl does not support https: it is
compiled without a TLS provider feature` — before a socket is opened.

TLS is decided once for the whole application — a provider feature turned on
anywhere in the build turns TLS on for every user of `flurl` in it. There are
three answers: no provider feature at all, `with-ring-tls`, or `with-rust-tls`.
None of them is a default — ask the user which of the three it is to be:

```toml
[dependencies]
# ring — mature, very widely deployed; costs a bundled C/assembly build.
flurl = { tag = "0.7.0", git = "https://github.com/MyJetTools/fl-url.git", features = [
    "with-ring-tls",
] }
```

```toml
[dependencies]
# pure Rust — no C toolchain anywhere, via rustls-graviola.
# x86_64 and aarch64 only; a younger, less deployed crypto implementation.
flurl = { tag = "0.7.0", git = "https://github.com/MyJetTools/fl-url.git", features = [
    "with-rust-tls",
] }
```

Enabling both is not an error (`--all-features` does it): my-tls resolves the
conflict in favour of ring.

For SSH tunneling support:

```toml
[dependencies]
flurl = { tag = "0.7.0", git = "https://github.com/MyJetTools/fl-url.git", features = [
    "with-ssh",
] }
```

### Feature flags

| Feature | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `with-ring-tls` | off | TLS on the **ring** provider. Enables `https://` plus [`with_client_certificate`](tls.md#client-certificate). Mature and widely deployed; costs a bundled C/assembly build. No `aws-lc-sys` either way. |
| `with-rust-tls` | off | The same, on a **pure-Rust** provider (`rustls-graviola`) — no C toolchain at all. Builds only on x86_64 and aarch64, and the implementation is far younger than ring. |
| `dangerous-tls` | off | A modifier, not a TLS switch: it makes [`accept_invalid_certificate()`](tls.md#accept-invalid-certificates) actually skip server-cert verification. Combine it with a provider feature — on its own the TLS code compiles but no provider is installed, so https fails at connect time. |
| `with-ssh` | off | [SSH tunneling](ssh.md) (`ssh://…->http://…`, `ssh://…->https://…` and `ssh://…->/path/to.sock` urls). Unix only. Built on `my-ssh`, which is `russh` underneath — no `libssh2` or OpenSSL, but this is the one feature that links `aws-lc-sys` (a bundled C build). |

On `wasm32` TLS is the browser's job, so neither provider feature matters there —
the `fetch` backend handles `https://` with or without them.

## Basic Usage

### Simple GET Request

```rust
use flurl::FlUrl;

let response = FlUrl::new("http://mywebsite.com")
    .append_path_segment("api")
    .append_path_segment("users")
    .append_query_param("page", Some("1"))
    .append_query_param("limit", Some("10"))
    .get()
    .await?;
```

### Errors Come From the Request

`FlUrl` is a builder: `FlUrl::new` and every method chained after it return the
builder, never a `Result`. What one of them can not use — the url, a header, a client
certificate — is remembered instead: from the first such error on every step is
skipped, and the call that sends the request returns that error without sending
anything. So one `?`, or one `match`, at the end covers the whole chain:

```rust
use flurl::{FlUrl, FlUrlError};

match FlUrl::new(url_from_settings)
    .append_path_segment("api")
    .with_header("X-Api-Key", api_key)
    .get()
    .await
{
    Ok(response) => {
        // A response arrived
    }
    Err(FlUrlError::InvalidUrl(reason)) => {
        // The url from settings can not be used
        eprintln!("Invalid URL: {}", reason);
    }
    Err(err) => {
        eprintln!("Error: {}", err);
    }
}
```

`FlUrl::new` does not panic on a url it can not use.

To check a url without sending anything — at start-up, say — ask the builder for the
error it is carrying. `get_url_builder()` gives the url as it stands, and once there
is an error it gives that error instead, so `get_url_builder().unwrap()` panics with
what was wrong with the url:

```rust
use flurl::FlUrl;

if let Some(err) = FlUrl::new(url_from_settings).get_error() {
    eprintln!("Invalid url in settings: {}", err);
}
```

The request fails with `FlUrlError::InvalidUrl` for a url that can not be used at all:

| url | why |
| --- | --- |
| `""`, `" "`, `http://`, `http://:8080`, `http:///path`, `http+unix://` | it names no host (for a unix socket — no socket file) |
| a host, or a socket path, that does not fit into 255 bytes together with its port | it is too long to be a host — usually something else pasted into the url's place |
| `ftp://host` | the scheme is not one FlUrl knows |
| `https://domain.com@backend.internal` | a malformed [`name@ip`](known-ip.md) form |
| `http://user@host:22->…`, `ssh://user@host:22x->…` | a malformed [ssh tunnel](ssh.md) part |

A url with no scheme is fine — `localhost:8080`, `10.0.0.1:5123/api` — and is taken
as `http://`. That is the native backend; under wasm a url that does not start with
`http://` or `https://` is resolved against the page origin instead — see
[Relative URLs](wasm.md#relative-urls-origin-resolution-wasm-only).

A url that parses but can not be put on the wire fails the request as well: a new
line or another control byte in the host, a space in the path (a value read from a
file together with its trailing new line is the usual source).

### Using String Literals (IntoFlUrl Trait)

```rust
use flurl::IntoFlUrl;

let response = "http://mywebsite.com"
    .append_path_segment("Row")
    .append_query_param("tableName", Some(table_name))
    .append_query_param("partitionKey", Some(partition_key))
    .get()
    .await?;
```

## HTTP Methods

Each of them has a `*_with_debug` twin that also dumps the request into a `&mut String`
— see [Request Debug String](debugging.md#request-debug-string) for the full list.

### GET

```rust
let response = FlUrl::new("https://api.example.com/data")
    .get()
    .await?;
```

### GET with Debug

```rust
let mut debug_string = String::new();
let response = FlUrl::new("https://api.example.com/data")
    .get_with_debug(&mut debug_string)
    .await?;
println!("Request: {}", debug_string);
```

### POST

```rust
use flurl::body::HttpRequestBody;

let body = HttpRequestBody::as_json(&my_data);
let response = FlUrl::new("https://api.example.com/users")
    .post(body)
    .await?;
```

### POST with Debug

```rust
let mut debug_string = String::new();
let body = HttpRequestBody::as_json(&my_data);
let response = FlUrl::new("https://api.example.com/users")
    .post_with_debug(body, &mut debug_string)
    .await?;
```

### PUT

```rust
let body = HttpRequestBody::as_json(&update_data);
let response = FlUrl::new("https://api.example.com/users/123")
    .put(body)
    .await?;
```

### PATCH

```rust
let body = HttpRequestBody::as_json(&patch_data);
let response = FlUrl::new("https://api.example.com/users/123")
    .patch(body)
    .await?;
```

### DELETE

```rust
let response = FlUrl::new("https://api.example.com/users/123")
    .delete()
    .await?;
```

### DELETE with Debug

```rust
let mut debug_string = String::new();
let response = FlUrl::new("https://api.example.com/users/123")
    .delete_with_debug(&mut debug_string)
    .await?;
```

### HEAD

```rust
let response = FlUrl::new("https://api.example.com/resource")
    .head()
    .await?;
```

## URL Building

### Append Path Segments

```rust
let response = FlUrl::new("https://api.example.com")
    .append_path_segment("api")
    .append_path_segment("v1")
    .append_path_segment("users")
    .get()
    .await?;
// Results in: https://api.example.com/api/v1/users
```

### Append Query Parameters

```rust
let response = FlUrl::new("https://api.example.com/search")
    .append_query_param("q", Some("rust"))
    .append_query_param("page", Some("1"))
    .append_query_param("sort", None::<&str>) // Adds parameter without value
    .get()
    .await?;
// Results in: https://api.example.com/search?q=rust&page=1&sort
```

### Append Raw URL Ending

```rust
let response = FlUrl::new("https://api.example.com")
    .append_raw_ending_to_url("/custom/path?param=value")
    .get()
    .await?;
```

## Headers

### Add Custom Headers

```rust
let response = FlUrl::new("https://api.example.com/data")
    .with_header("Authorization", "Bearer token123")
    .with_header("X-Custom-Header", "value")
    .get()
    .await?;
```

A header that must not be put on the wire fails the request with
`FlUrlError::RequestBuild` — nothing is sent, and the header is not silently dropped:

- a value with a CR, LF or NUL in it — typically an api key read from a file together
  with its trailing new line;
- a name that is empty or is not an HTTP token (a space, a `:`, a non-ASCII letter).

`with_header` itself can not report this (it returns the builder), so the error comes
from the call that sends the request. The message names the header and the byte, never
the value. The same applies to the header fields of a
[request model](model-driven-requests.md).

That check is the native backend's. Under wasm a header goes to the browser as it is,
and one the browser refuses fails the request with `FlUrlError::FetchError`.

## Request Bodies

### JSON Body

```rust
use flurl::body::HttpRequestBody;
use serde::Serialize;

#[derive(Serialize)]
struct User {
    name: String,
    email: String,
}

let user = User {
    name: "John Doe".to_string(),
    email: "john@example.com".to_string(),
};

let response = FlUrl::new("https://api.example.com/users")
    .post(HttpRequestBody::as_json(&user))
    .await?;
```

### URL-Encoded Body

```rust
use flurl::body::UrlEncodedBody;

let body = UrlEncodedBody::new()
    .append("username", "john")
    .append("password", "secret123")
    .append("remember", "true");

let response = FlUrl::new("https://api.example.com/login")
    .post(body)
    .await?;
```

### Multipart Form Data

```rust
use flurl::body::new_form_data;

// Form fields (`new_form_data()` generates a random multipart boundary)
let form_data = new_form_data()
    .append_form_data_field("username", "john")
    .append_form_data_field("email", "john@example.com");

let response = FlUrl::new("https://api.example.com/profile")
    .post(form_data)
    .await?;

// Form with file upload
let form_data = new_form_data()
    .append_form_data_field("title", "My Document")
    .append_form_data_file("file", "document.pdf", "application/pdf", &file_bytes);

let response = FlUrl::new("https://api.example.com/upload")
    .post(form_data)
    .await?;
```

### Raw Body

```rust
use flurl::body::HttpRequestBody;

let raw_data = b"custom binary data";
let body = HttpRequestBody::from_raw_data(raw_data.to_vec(), Some("application/octet-stream"));

let response = FlUrl::new("https://api.example.com/upload")
    .post(body)
    .await?;
```

Every body above is held in memory as a whole. A body of any size at constant memory: topic [`streamed-body`](streamed-body.md). A request described by a `MyHttpInput` model: topic [`model-driven-requests`](model-driven-requests.md).

## Response Handling

### Get Status Code

```rust
let mut response = FlUrl::new("https://api.example.com/data")
    .get()
    .await?;

let status_code = response.get_status_code();
println!("Status: {}", status_code);
```

### Get Body as Slice

```rust
let mut response = FlUrl::new("https://api.example.com/data")
    .get()
    .await?;

let body = response.get_body_as_slice().await?;
println!("Body length: {}", body.len());
```

### Get Body as String

```rust
let mut response = FlUrl::new("https://api.example.com/data")
    .get()
    .await?;

let body = response.get_body_as_str().await?;
println!("Body: {}", body);
```

### Get JSON Response

```rust
use serde::Deserialize;

#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct ApiResponse {
    data: Vec<String>,
}

let mut response = FlUrl::new("https://api.example.com/data")
    .get()
    .await?;

let api_response: ApiResponse = response.get_json().await?;
```

### Receive Full Body

```rust
let mut response = FlUrl::new("https://api.example.com/data")
    .get()
    .await?;

let body_bytes = response.receive_body().await?;
```

### Streaming Response

```rust
let response = FlUrl::new("https://api.example.com/large-file")
    .get()
    .await?;

let mut stream = response.get_body_as_stream();
while let Some(chunk) = stream.get_next_chunk().await? {
    // Process chunk
    println!("Received {} bytes", chunk.len());
}
```

The chunks are read off the connection as they come. Called after a buffered read
(`get_body_as_slice`, `get_json`, …), `get_body_as_stream` gives the body that read
loaded; after one that failed, its first chunk fails with the reason.

### Get Headers

```rust
let mut response = FlUrl::new("https://api.example.com/data")
    .get()
    .await?;

// Get specific header
let content_type = response.get_header("Content-Type")?;

// Get header case-insensitive
let content_type = response.get_header_case_insensitive("content-type")?;

// Get all headers. The names come back lower-cased: `content-type`
let headers = response.get_headers();
for (key, value) in headers {
    println!("{}: {:?}", key, value);
}
```

### Redirects

FlUrl does not follow redirects. A `3xx` answer comes back as it is, with its
`Location` header, and no request goes to the address it names:

```rust
let mut response = FlUrl::new("https://api.example.com/old-path")
    .get()
    .await?;

if (300..400).contains(&response.get_status_code()) {
    let location = response.get_header("Location")?;
    println!("Moved to: {:?}", location);
}
```

To go where the redirect points, read `Location` and make the next request yourself.
A relative `Location` (`/other`) is resolved against the url of the request. When the
new address is on another host, do not carry over `Authorization`, `Cookie` and
other credentials that were meant for the first one.

Under wasm the request is made by the browser's `fetch`, which follows redirects
itself: the response you get is the one at the end of the redirects, not the
redirect.

## Error Handling

```rust
use flurl::{FlUrl, FlUrlError};

match FlUrl::new("https://api.example.com/data").get().await {
    Ok(response) => {
        // A response arrived — whatever its status code
    }
    Err(FlUrlError::Timeout) => {
        // No response within `set_timeout`
    }
    Err(FlUrlError::InvalidUrl(reason)) | Err(FlUrlError::UnsupportedScheme(reason)) => {
        // The url can not be used, or this build can not serve its scheme
    }
    Err(FlUrlError::RequestBuild(reason)) => {
        // The request could not be built — nothing was sent
    }
    Err(err) => {
        // Everything else, a failed connection included
        eprintln!("Error: {}", err);
    }
}
```

- **The errors of the builder come out here too** — a url that can not be used, a
  header that must not go on the wire, a client certificate for a url that is not
  `https://`. See [Errors Come From the Request](#errors-come-from-the-request).
- **A status code is not an error.** `404` and `500` come back as `Ok(response)`;
  read `response.get_status_code()`.
- **`FlUrlError` is `#[non_exhaustive]`**, so a `match` on it needs a catch-all arm.
- **A failed connection** — refused, reset, a TLS handshake that did not go through —
  is `FlUrlError::MyHttpClientError` on native (its payload is
  `flurl::my_http_client::MyHttpClientError`) and `FlUrlError::FetchError` under
  wasm. Each variant exists on its own backend only, so code meant for both leaves
  them to the catch-all arm.
- **`err.is_timeout()`** is `true` for a timeout however it was reported.
- **Reading the body has errors of its own**: `get_json` fails with
  `FlUrlError::SerializationError` on a body that is not the expected JSON,
  `get_body_as_str` with `FlUrlError::CanNotConvertToUtf8`, any read with
  `FlUrlError::Timeout` once `set_response_body_timeout` runs out, and a buffered read
  with `FlUrlError::ResponseBodyTooLarge` once the body is over
  [the size limit](timeouts-and-limits.md#response-body-size).

## Examples

### Complete Example: API Client

```rust
use flurl::{FlUrl, body::HttpRequestBody};
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(Serialize)]
struct CreateUser {
    name: String,
    email: String,
}

#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct User {
    id: u64,
    name: String,
    email: String,
}

async fn create_user(name: &str, email: &str) -> Result<User, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let user_data = CreateUser {
        name: name.to_string(),
        email: email.to_string(),
    };
    
    let mut response = FlUrl::new("https://api.example.com")
        .append_path_segment("users")
        .with_header("Authorization", "Bearer token123")
        .post(HttpRequestBody::as_json(&user_data))
        .await?;
    
    let user: User = response.get_json().await?;
    Ok(user)
}

async fn get_user(id: u64) -> Result<User, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let mut response = FlUrl::new("https://api.example.com")
        .append_path_segment("users")
        .append_path_segment(id.to_string())
        .with_header("Authorization", "Bearer token123")
        .get()
        .await?;
    
    let user: User = response.get_json().await?;
    Ok(user)
}
```

## Thread Safety

- A `FlUrl` is one request: every builder method and every method that sends takes it by value, so an instance is never shared — build a new one per request
- On native `FlUrl` is `Send + Sync` and the futures of its requests are `Send`, so a request can be built in one task and sent from another, or handed to `tokio::spawn`. Under wasm the futures are `!Send`
- Connection cache (`FlUrlHttpConnectionsCache`) is thread-safe
- Multiple async tasks can safely use different `FlUrl` instances concurrently
