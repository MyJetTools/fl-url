    /// This path is hyper HTTP/1.1 only: the mode is pinned to
    /// [`FlUrlMode::Http1Hyper`] regardless of [`Self::update_mode`], because the own
    /// HTTP/1.1 implementation serializes a request into one buffer and the h2 client
    /// has no streaming entry point.
    ///
    /// **Framing** is what `content_length` picks. HTTP/1.1 delimits a request body
    /// exactly two ways (RFC 9112 §6), and these are they:
    ///
    /// * `None` → `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`. The length never has to be known, and
    ///   every HTTP/1.1 recipient is required to understand chunked, so this is the
    ///   default a streamed body wants.
    /// * `Some(n)` → `Content-Length: n`, no chunked. For endpoints that refuse a
    ///   chunked request body, and for anything that has to know the size before it
    ///   starts reading.
    ///
    /// With `Some(n)` the body must then deliver **exactly** `n` bytes. That is the
    /// protocol's rule, not fl-url's: a short body makes the message incomplete, and
    /// extra bytes would be read as the start of the next request on the same
    /// connection. A stream that ends early therefore fails the request
    /// (`"user body write aborted"`) instead of putting a truncated payload on the
    /// wire — so `n` and the producer must come from one source (a file's metadata and
    /// that same file), never be computed twice.
    ///
    /// `content_length` is the single source of the framing, so it overrides a
    /// `Content-Length` added with [`Self::with_header`] in both directions: `Some(n)`
    /// replaces such a header (never emits a second one, which would be a protocol
    /// violation), and `None` removes it, because a body of unknown size must not
    /// claim a length it may not deliver.
    ///
    /// Three builder knobs do not apply, and none of them fails quietly:
    ///
    /// * [`Self::compress`] gzips the body as one buffer, which is exactly what
    ///   streaming avoids → [`FlUrlError::StreamedBodyCanNotBeCompressed`].
    /// * [`Self::with_retries`] and [`Self::with_retry`] are ignored: the payload is
    ///   consumed as it is sent, so the request is attempted exactly once. Rebuilding
    ///   the stream and calling again is the caller's decision — it owns the source
    ///   data.
    /// * [`Self::set_timeout`] covers the **whole** call, upload included, not just
    ///   the wait for the response head. The 10s default is far too short for a real
    ///   upload; set it to the size of the transfer you expect.
